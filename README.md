Human Resources System (Syst√®me RH)

This project is a simple Human Resources management system using SQLite as the database. It allows you to manage employees and departments, store relevant data (such as employee salaries and roles), and retrieve information about employees and departments. The system is designed in Python using classes and SQLite to simulate a real-world HR system.
